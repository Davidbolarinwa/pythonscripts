# Applying AWS S3 Data Lifecycle Management Script

To apply the custom script for managing the lifecycle of data in an Amazon S3 bucket, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Make sure you have AWS credentials configured on the machine where you'll be running the script. This can be achieved by setting environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) or using a credentials file.

2. **Install Boto3**:
   Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python and is required to interact with AWS services. You can install it using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
3. **Modify the Script**: Open the script in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) and make the necessary changes:

**NOTE**:Replace 'your-bucket-name' with the actual name of your S3 bucket.

**NOTE**: Adjust the prefix variable to match the path within the bucket that you want to manage.

**Run the Script** : Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located. Run the script using the following command:

 ```python:

python s3lifecycle.py

```

**NOTE** Rename files name if necessary s3lifecycle.py with the actual name of the script file.

**Review Output** : As the script runs, it will print messages indicating the actions it is taking, such as transitioning objects to Infrequent Access or deleting objects. Review the output to ensure that the script is working as expected.

**Schedule the Script** (Optional): If you want to automate this process, you can set up a scheduled task or cron job to run the script at specified intervals. This way, your S3 data lifecycle management can be handled automatically.
